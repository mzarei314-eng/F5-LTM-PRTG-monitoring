## ðŸ”§ Setup / Configuration

1. **Collect OIDs**  
   - Use `snmpwalk` from your PRTG server to gather OIDs related to:
     - Current connections for Virtual Servers
     - Pool Members
   - Example command:  
     ```bash
     snmpwalk -v2c -c COMMUNITY F5_DEVICE_IP
     ```

2. **Add Custom Sensors in PRTG**  
   - In PRTG, create a **Custom SNMP Sensor** for each OID collected.
   - Configure thresholds and alert settings as needed.

3. **Run Monitoring Script**  
   - Configure device credentials in `config.py`
   - Run `monitor.py` to automatically collect status and feed data to PRTG.
